# My Data Science Learning Journey üöÄ

Welcome! This repo tracks my 12-month journey to become a data scientist, following a structured plan from foundations to advanced topics. I'll share code, projects, notes, and reflections here. Follow along or fork for your own path!

## Quick Overview
- **Start Date**: September 2025
- **Goal**: Build skills in Python, ML, DL, and specialize (TBD: NLP or CV).
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1 (Months 1-4)**: Foundations (Python, Git, SQL, Math/Stats)
  - **Phase 2 (Months 5-8)**: Intermediate (Data Viz, ML Basics, Portfolio Project)
  - **Phase 3 (Months 9-12)**: Advanced (DL, Specialization, Capstone)

Current progress:
